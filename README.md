# Action Plan for Bomberman

## Phase 1: Setup and Architecture (2 days)

###  Architecture Design
- [x] Design WebSocket protocol schema for game messages
- [x] Design game state structure (shared between client and server)
- [x] Plan client-side game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Design component system for game entities (players, bombs, etc.)

## Phase 2: Core Game Implementation (5 days)

###  Map System (component)
make component tilemap have this property
- [x] Implement fixed map layout with walls and destructible blocks
- [x] Create random block generation algorithm
- [x] Ensure valid player starting positions in corners
- [x] Implement map rendering using mini-framework DOM manipulation

###  Player Mechanics (component)
make player component can change x,y and name of player
you can make 2 component cuurplayer and autherPlayers or collection them
- [ ] Implement player movement (4-directional)
- [ ] Add bomb placement logic
- [ ] Create explosion mechanics (4-directional)
- [ ] Implement collision detection with walls/blocks/players

### Game Rules & Power-ups
- [ ] Add 3-life system per player
- [ ] Implement power-up system (random drops from blocks)
  - Bomb capacity
  - Flame range
  - Movement speed
- [ ] Create win condition (last player standing)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile game loop for 60fps consistency
- [ ] Optimize DOM updates (minimize reflows/repaints)
- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequent elements (explosions, etc.)
- [ ] Test with simulated heavy load

### Multiplayer Basics
here you should make websocket as have lot of types (status player join event ...)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection handling
- [ ] Create player synchronization
- [ ] Handle client prediction for smooth movement
- [ ] Implement basic lag compensation

## Phase 3: User Experience (3 days)

### Lobby System
- [ ] Create nickname entry screen
- [ ] Implement player waiting room with counter
- [ ] Add game start timers (20s wait, 10s countdown)
- [ ] Design responsive UI for all screens

### Chat System
- [ ] Implement WebSocket chat functionality
- [ ] Create chat UI with message history
- [ ] Add player name differentiation
- [ ] Implement chat message throttling

###  Polish and Testing
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for actions
- [ ] Create game over screen with winner announcement
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Phase 4: Deployment and Final Checks (2 days)

### Server Deployment
- [ ] Set up production server environment
- [ ] Configure WebSocket secure connection (wss://)
- [ ] Implement basic server-side validation
- [ ] Load testing with multiple simultaneous games

### Final Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive gameplay testing
- [ ] Performance validation (60fps under load)
- [ ] Write basic user documentation
- [ ] Create simple installation/run instructions

## Technical Considerations

### Client-side (JS with mini-framework)
- Game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- DOM-based rendering (no Canvas/WebGL)
- Input handling for keyboard controls
- State synchronization with server
- Predictive movement for smooth gameplay

### Server-side (Golang)
- WebSocket connection management
- Game state authority and validation
- Message routing between clients
- Room/match management
- Anti-cheat basic measures

### Performance Strategies
- Object pooling for game entities
- Minimal DOM updates (batch where possible)
- Efficient collision detection
- Throttled network updates
- Client-side prediction

## Risk Management
- Performance issues: Build with optimization in mind from start
- Network latency: Implement client prediction and interpolation
- Synchronization problems: Use deterministic game logic
- Browser compatibility: Test early on target platforms

This plan provides a structured 2-week timeline for development, with each day focused on specific components. The modular approach allows for parallel work on different systems where possible.
